# Economic Resilience Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach
#### Predicting Economic Growth Stability with 99.8% Accuracy

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning approach to predicting economic stability that achieves 99.8% accuracy in forecasting economic growth stability patterns. Our methodology seeks to transform economic crisis management from reactive response to proactive prevention.

### Key Achievement
- R² = 0.998: accuracy for economic growth stability
- Validated across 5 major economic crises (1997-2022)
- 38 countries, 34 years of comprehensive analysis
- feature engineering approach using time-varying economic indicators

### Innovation Breakthrough
Rather than chasing countries with the highest growth spikes, I trained models to recognize those with the most consistent, stable growth over time . The growth_stability_target.variable alone drove a near‑perfect fit (R² = 0.998) in XGBoost, proving that long-term stability is a powerful signal of economic resilience

### Business Impact
- Early Warning System: 6-18 month advance prediction of economic instability
- Crisis Prevention: Potential to prevent billions in economic losses
- Policy Guidance: Evidence-based recommendations for economic interventions
- Risk Assessment: Quantified country-level vulnerability analysis

### Methodology
- Core Innovation: Advanced Feature Engineering
The breakthrough in this project comes from our feature engineering approach in 02_feature_engineering_advanced.ipynb:

### Traditional Approach Problems:
- Static country-level resilience scores
- Fixed characteristics assumption
- Poor predictive power (30-50% accuracy)

### Our take: Time-Varying Features
- Growth Stability Targets: Year-varying stability measures instead of static scores
- Temporal Dynamics: Lag features, momentum indicators, and trend analysis
- Economic Complexity: Multi-dimensional stability and performance indicators
- Shock-Aware Features: Historical learning and vulnerability patterns

### Key Feature Categories:
- Stability Measures: Inverse volatility indicators for economic growth
- Temporal Features: 3-year rolling windows, momentum, and acceleration
- Economic Complexity: Financial development, innovation capacity, trade integration
- Historical Context: Past shock experience and recovery patterns
- Period Effects: Era-specific economic conditions and global trends

### Target Variable Definition
- Primary Target: growth_stability_target
#### Definition: Inverse coefficient of variation of GDP growth (higher = more stable)
- Innovation: Year-varying target suitable for ML prediction
- Business Meaning: Economic growth consistency rather than growth level
This variable isolates a core dimension of economic resilience: low volatility in GDP growth over multiple years, which often reflects strong institutions, diversified economies, and effective policy. This target represents not a moment of strength, but a track record of resilience.
